OneLetter
======

OneLetter is the best way to find a word in any language and hear its
pronunciation immediately.
OneLetter uses word-lists from movie subtitles for a database and enables you to instantly search through it all, with a button to hear the pronunciation from Forvo instantly.

OneLetter uses AngularJS and Forvo API.
